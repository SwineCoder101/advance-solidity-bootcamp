1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of the 256 bit word length in the EVM
Advantages:
- It could be benificial to larger computations as the evm can store large chunks of memory in trade off for large cpu operations.
This helps with cryptography operations without splitting words.

Disadvantages:
- It can be innefficient for small computations/operations which do not require the full 256 word length, this can result in waste of storage space
the overhead can also result in higher gas costs


2. What would happen if the implementation of a precompiled contract varied between Ethereum clients ?
There would be issues with consensus across the clients as all behave differently the states would be incoherent with each other.
If two clients come to different states of the same input of a computation that can lead to a conflict of states and cause a chain split.

3. Using Remix write a simple contract that uses a memory variable, then using the debugger step through the function and inspect the memory.
