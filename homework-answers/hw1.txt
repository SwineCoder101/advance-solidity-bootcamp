1. Why is client diversity important for Ethereum
This reduces risk of bugs or vulnerabilities from taking down the entire network. 
It ensures resiliency within the network for any implementation deployed

2. Where is the full Ethereum state held ?
the state is held within data structures called state trie, there are four types world, transaction, reciept and account storage


3. What is a replay attack ? , which 2 pieces of information
can prevent it ?
An attacker copies a victims transactions and replays it on chain. This can be handled via a nonce which can get incremented for 
every transaction or duplicate transaction hashes

4. In a contract, how do we know who called a view function ?
we can view the address of the caller through msg.sender, this is local to the contract
